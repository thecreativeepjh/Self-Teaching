        <p >This is a very important question to ask before you starting. In this section we will layout some of the reasons to teach yourself, and a few important things to consider.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <h3 >Benifits</h3>
        <ul >
            <li>Learning at a comfortable pace: This is one of the most ovious, but also important benifits. For example, if you are a fast learner, you can go faster, and learn more without other people slowing you down. </li>
            <li>Flexibility: One that is worth mentioning, is that you are not trapped into constricting coriculum. You can learn what you want, when you want.</li>
            <li>Improved problem solving skils: When you have to learn things for youself, you have to find solutions, and answers to your own questions. This is basiclly textbook problem solving skils</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that we have gone over some important benifits, we should list some of the possible downsides or challeges, and ways to solve them.</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p><b>Motivation or Discipline:</b> When learning with a ridged platform, you find yourself not motivated to learning, often leaving things half finished.</p>
        <p><b>Solution:</b> The best solution to this problem is either joining a program with a streak system like duolingo, or having friends join you.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p> </p>
        <P><b>Disinformation:</b> If you are not carefull you may find wrong infromation online.</P>
        <p><b>Solution:</b> Use reputible sources, and read the 'How To Teach Yourself' section later on.</p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>In conclusion, it is your choice, but there is no strong reason not to.</p>
